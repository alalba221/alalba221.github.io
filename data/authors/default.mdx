Hello, my name is Yue Zhang, and I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at Clemson University, with plans to graduate by December 2025. 
Over the years, I have cultivated a strong foundation in software development, computer graphics, and engineering.

Professionally, I have experience as a Software Engineer Intern at Qualcomm, where I worked on enhancing D3D12 driver frameworks. 
My research assistant roles at Clemson University and UT Dallas allowed me to delve into Computer Graphics and 3D human and face reconstruction. Additionally, my work as a BIM Engineer provided hands-on experience in infrastructure modeling and design visualization.

My technical expertise includes C++, Vulkan, OpenGL, Python,d3.js, and Unity, complemented by projects such as developing a Vulkan-based Renderer and real-time path tracers. With a passion for computer graphics and parallel computing, I strive to contribute innovative solutions to complex challenges.
