`std::cerr` is not very flexible: it's hard to format, lacks log levels, cannot save logs, and doesn't allow control over output to either the console or a file. So, before we start writing our asset manager, let’s first improve our LogSystem—sharpening the axe doesn’t delay the work of cutting firewood.

# Importing spdlog
Here, we choose to use the third-party library spdlog and wrap it with simple macros for easier usage.
spdlog is a header-only library, making it both simple and efficient to use.
To learn more about spdlog, you can refer directly to the [official documentation](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/wiki).
Integrating spdlog into your project is very straightforward:

### Add a Git Repository as a Submodule.
```git submodule add https://github.com/gabime/spdlog.git external/spdlog```
### Add it to the CMakeLists.txt file under the external folder.
```cmake
set(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS OFF CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
# Ensures the spdlog target is only added once to prevent duplicate target definitions.
if (NOT TARGET spdlog) # Checks whether a target named spdlog has already been defined.
    option(SPDLOG_BUILD_EXAMPLE "" OFF)
    option(SPDLOG_INSTALL "" OFF)
    add_subdirectory(spdlog)

    # The FOLDER property places the target into the external/spdlog folder in IDEs like Visual Studio.
    set_target_properties(spdlog PROPERTIES FOLDER external/spdlog)
endif()
```
# Wraping spdlog as LogSystem
**LogSystem** is part of the `core layer`—it provides fundamental library functionalities. Therefore, we add a log folder inside core to house our `log_system.cpp/h` files.
The most important variable in LogSystem is an `spdlog::logger` class member named `m_logger`. A logger is the log object, and each logger contains a vector of `sink`s. A `sink` is a target for log output. Each sink can be assigned a priority level, and the `logger` itself can also have a priority level.

In the constructor, we create a multi-threaded `sink` with color output and bind it to an `asynchronous logger`. However, in reality, we only set up a single thread. The output format is set using the `set_pattern` function. You can directly refer to the spdlog [Custom Formatting](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/wiki/3.-Custom-formatting#pattern-flags) for details. The syntax is based on the fmt library, and you can find more in [fmt syntax](https://fmt.dev/11.0/syntax/).
> [!NOTE]
> **Asynchronous Logger** (async logger): When using asynchronous logging, log output statements and business logic statements do not run on the same thread. Instead, a dedicated thread is used for log output operations, allowing the main thread handling business logic to proceed without waiting.

We use an enum class to define log levels:

- debug: Used to record information valuable to developers.
- info: Informational messages such as service start/stop events or configuration assumptions.
- warn: Warnings about potential errors, such as switching from a primary server to a backup server, retrying operations, or losing auxiliary data.
- error: Errors that do not prevent the program from continuing to run. Such errors may cause the program to deviate from the expected behavior from the "operator's perspective."
- fatal: Errors severe enough to cause the program to exit, such as accessing illegal memory. In this case, we need to display a "fatal error" message and attempt to save our data (you can refer to Wikipedia for more on fatal errors).
- In the log member function, we use the logger wrapper to implement logging functionality.

It’s worth noting that for fatal errors, we can terminate the program by throwing an error with throw `std::runtime_error`.

# Wraping LogSystem as Macros
```cpp
#define LOG_HELPER(LOG_LEVEL, ...) \
g_runtime_global_context.m_logger_system->log(LOG_LEVEL, "[" + std::string(__FUNCTION__) + "] " + __VA_ARGS__);
// __FUNCTION__: 目前所在函数
#define LOG_DEBUG(...) LOG_HELPER(LogSystem::LogLevel::debug, __VA_ARGS__);
#define LOG_INFO(...) LOG_HELPER(LogSystem::LogLevel::info, __VA_ARGS__);
#define LOG_WARN(...) LOG_HELPER(LogSystem::LogLevel::warn, __VA_ARGS__);
#define LOG_ERROR(...) LOG_HELPER(LogSystem::LogLevel::error, __VA_ARGS__);
#define LOG_FATAL(...) LOG_HELPER(LogSystem::LogLevel::fatal, __VA_ARGS__);
```
Finally, you only need to create the `logger` during the initialization of the global context
