# filesystem

## `std::filesystem::absolute(path)`

- This function attempts to convert the provided path into an absolute path.
- If the path is relative, it resolves it relative to the current working directory.
- If the path is already absolute, it simply returns the same path.

# Run cmd

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<FILE, decltype(&_pclose)> pipe(_popen(cmd, "r"), _pclose);
```

- `std::unique_ptr<FILE, decltype(&_pclose)>:`

  - This declares a std::unique_ptr that manages a FILE\* resource.
  - The second template parameter, decltype(&\_pclose), specifies the type of the custom deleter function, which is \_pclose in this case.
  - `_pclose` is used to close the pipe created by \_popen.

- `_popen(cmd, "r"):`

  - `_popen` is a Microsoft-specific function (used on Windows) that opens a process by creating a pipe, for example, to execute a shell command.
  - The `cmd` is the command to execute.
  - The `"r"` mode specifies that the pipe is opened for reading (standard output of the command).

- `_pclose`:

  - `_pclose` is a corresponding function to close the pipe opened by \_popen.

- `std::unique_ptr` Construction:

  - The `std::unique_ptr` is initialized with:
  - The `FILE*` pointer returned by `_popen`.
  - The `_pclose` function, which acts as the custom deleter.
